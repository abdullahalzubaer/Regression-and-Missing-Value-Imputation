# Imputing missing values using KNN-imputation approach and then fitting the data using RandomForestRegressor

Real world is full of missing values ! Either we ignore the samples that has missing values or we impute them

Objective: To work with dataset that has missing values, impute them and apply classifications algorithm to compare performance with and without impuation.

## TODO
* [ ] Provide proper documentaiton
* [ ] Dataset characteristics
* [ ] Try different imputation methods (for example, mean, median 
* [ ] Try other Regression algorithms
* [ ] Provide the results of using different impuation methods and no impuation (Comparison)
* [ ] Select the features based on feature imporatnce (now it is selected intuitively)
* [ ] Dive deep into if it makes sense to encode the values of some features
